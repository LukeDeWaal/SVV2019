Code folder, put all important code here.

Code Development Rules:
1 - We use Test Driven Development
=> Write tests before / during development of sourcecode
=> Do not delete tests. They serve as documentation and make sure changes to code dont break fundamental features

2 - Push to a branch, all members must confirm merges to prevent code-loss

3 - Coding is to be done in Python 3.6

4 - Use Object Oriented programming for easy project and part integration
